Random thoughts.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


iterator: accept only arrays
contextual-string/uri: only accept non-arrays
		
		
in json schemas, "id" is used to set an "anchor", so we cannot use it as property name.
	-> we use "guid" instead (Globally Unique Identifier)
	
RefResolver::maxDepth -> 7 is a bit too short. increase. 
	however we must watch performances. Perhaps flatten schemas at some point?
	
how to merge contextual string and URI  definitions ?

project: forbid additional values?

iterator: accepts integers?????

we will need a type for table data
